# full_stack_open_part3_servers
This repo represents my journey through Part 3 of the Full Stack Open bootcamp by Helsinki University, where I delved into server-side development with Node.js and Express. Here, I've explored the essentials of handling HTTP, routing, middleware, and database integration, while also gaining insights into key concepts like RESTful APIs, user authentication, and security. As I continue on this path toward becoming a proficient full-stack developer, I'm enthusiastic about applying these newfound skills to create dynamic and secure web applications.
